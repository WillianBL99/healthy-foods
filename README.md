## üìù Description

Healthy Foods is a web application that allows users to search for proudcts and get information about them created for the challenge (**NodeJs Challenge 20201030**)

## üìå Solved Problem

The main problem that this application solves is that it allows users to use the Foods platform as a data import base and can edit according to their need. This allows on the first day of use to have access to a vast amount of food options to help the food health professional's day.

## üíΩ Database

This project uses a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database.
- **Database name:** `healthy-foods`
- **`Collections`:**
  - **`products`:** Stores all products
  - **`paramsUpdated`:** Stores the params that were updated
  - **`information`:** Stores the updates information

## üèîÔ∏è Challenges

In this project, the main challenge was to create a way to update the database with the zip files provided by the **Foods API**. To solve this problem I created a [cron job](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cron) that runs every 24 hours combined with the use of the [Axios](https://axios-http.com/ptbr/docs/intro) library and the [Zlib](https://nodejs.org/api/zlib.html) and [fs](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) modules of the node that asked to create a stream that unpacks and converts to JSON while saving the file in the application.
